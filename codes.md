## Nebunoid Cheats

Nebunoid comes with a collection of cheat codes, accessed via **F11** while the game is running. Cheat codes which alter gameplay require acknowledgement that they will disqualify high scores and void star earnings before they can be used.

* LevelAxe: Resets level progress and makes the game forget passwords. Fair warning; this will also cause secret levels to be forgotten, and stars to be lost.
* IwantToPlay: Adds a new player to the match. Uses the lowest current level of the existing players, difficulty permitting. Max 6 players in a match.
* SkipTurn: Skips the active player's turn without messing with the life count. Only effective in a hotseat match while the active player has no balls in play.
* PumpkinEater: Expresses acknowledgement that the player(s) are cheating. Required to activate any cheat code underneath.
* Immortal: Adds 3 lives to the active player's stock.
* BiggiePaddle: Extends paddle size by 70 pixels.
* PewPew: Adds 100 bullets to the ammo stock. (Will replace missiles.)
* CapShower: Attempts to generate a barrage of capsules. (Subject to current level specs, difficulty settings, and Diminishing Returns.)
* WarpAway: Exits the current level.
* BackInTime: Restarts the current level.
* TimeFrost: Activates or amplifies a Blizzard effect.
* CurveDown: Activates Gravity Balls effect(s).

If a player misspells after expressing acknowledgement, the active player will be dealt a random punishment.
