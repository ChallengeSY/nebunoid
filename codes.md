## Nebunoid Cheats

Nebunoid comes with a collection of cheat codes, accessed via F11 while the game is running. Cheat codes which alter gameplay require acknowledgement that they will disqualify high scores and void star earnings before they can be used.

* LevelAxe: Resets level progress and makes the game forget passwords. Fair warning; this will also cause secret levels to be forgotten, and stars to be lost.
* IwantToPlay: Adds a new player to the match. Uses the lowest current level of the existing players, difficulty permitting. Max 6 players in a match.
* SkipTurn: Skips the active player's turn. Only effective in a hotseat match while the active player has no balls in play.
* PumpkinEater: Expresses acknowledgement that the player(s) are cheating. Required to activate any cheat code underneath.
* Immortal: Adds 3 lives to the active player's stock.
* BiggiePaddle: Extends paddle size by 70 pixels.
* PewPew: Adds 100 bullets to the ammo stock. (Will replace missiles.)
* CapShower: Attempts to generate a barrage of capsules. (Subject to current level specs, difficulty settings, and Diminishing Returns.)
* WarpAway: Exits the current level.
* BackInTime: Restarts the current level.
* TimeFrost: Activates or amplifies a Blizzard effect.
* CurveDown: Activates Gravity Balls effect(s).

If a player misspells after expressing acknowledgement, the active player will be dealt a random punishment.
